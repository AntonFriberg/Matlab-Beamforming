# Matlab-Beamforming
Creates an ultrasound image from raw signal data contained in the data folder. The program calculates
the listening depth of each transducer element and uses it to reposition the signal data so that
data from the same listening area is on the same row. The program then performs dynamic focus with
apodization and merges all transducer data into a single line. The lines are combined into an image
which is high-pass filtered and hilbert transformed.
